# Employee Tracker

## Description
In order to help organize a business, a database using MySQL was created to view and manage departments, roles, and employees.

## Installation
Node.js is required to be downloaded to use this application. Needed dependencies are in the package.json file. Simply write 'npm i' into your terminal to install Inquirer and MySQL2.

## Usage
Before starting, please make sure to add your MySQL password into the server.js file. 

To view your database, you need to run 'node server.js' into your terminal. From there, you will see a list of options. Simply choose the one you wish to use, and follow any given prompts.

## Extra
The Update an Employee Role option needs to be fixed as it currently doesn't work.
Also need to figure out how to make it so the choices can be based on a name instead of it's id number, so it's you're not left guessing what the id numbers are referring to.
